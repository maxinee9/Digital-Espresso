        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Digital Espresso was born from a deep love for coffee and a relentless spirit of adventure. Our founder, a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast, spent years exploring cafes around the world, sampling everything from bold espressos to intricate pour-overs. But she wanted more—something fresh, something unexpected.</p>
        <p>Blending her love for coffee with a passion for tropical and exotic flavors, she began experimenting with unique ingredients: bright hints of pineapple, smooth coconut cream, tangy passion fruit, and more. Her wild, inventive combinations surprised her, blending seamlessly to create flavors she’d never imagined. She knew she couldn’t keep these discoveries to herself.</p>
        <p>Today, Digital Espresso brings you coffee like you’ve never tasted before. We’re an online coffee shop with a twist, delivering adventurous, tropical-inspired coffee creations straight to your door. We believe coffee should be bold, creative, and a little bit daring—just like the people who drink it. So take a sip, try something new, and discover what coffee can be with Digital Espresso.</p>
